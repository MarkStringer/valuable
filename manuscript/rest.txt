##The Good Enough Parent
There's an idea in Freud's writing - the pleasure principle.  The idea is that when we're babies we go through a period where whatever we need is given to us.  When we're hungry we're fed, when we've soiled ourselves, we're cleaned, when we're tired we can go to sleep, when we're awake, we can wake up (even if it's the middle of the night). And this period stops.  For the rest of our lives, we don't always get what we want, when we want and this is very upsetting. I think most of us never get over it.
When I was explaining this to friend of mine Tim Diggins, he pointed me in the direction of D.W. Winnicott and the concept of the "Good Enough Parent." The idea, I think of the "Good Enough Parent" is one that provides enough support for the child to deal with the brutal and uncertain nature of the world, but at the same time, doesn't hide the child from it's brutal and uncertain nature.
The image that came into my mind just then was of that day when the parent decides that they're going to take the stabilisers (trainer wheels) off of the bike and let the child ride without them. There's a kind of memory of this - so clichéd that you might doubt that it actually happened to you, of the parent standing behind the child and holding the saddle and moving the child forward saying to the child "peddle, peddle, I'm holding you." And of course, there's that amazing moment when the child is peddling and moving forward and suddenly realises that their parent can't be holding them. Of course, there's no guarantee that they're not going to fall off immediately after that.  But for a moment there, they were doing it, they were riding the bike, all by them selves.
I remember crying a lot when I learned to ride a bike (it only took an afternoon).  But I also remember that amazing feeling of *balance* of the bike magically moving in the right direction under my control. And I remember my dad being endlessly patient as I was trying to get the hang of it probably saying something like "It's all right, just have a go, I'm holding you, you can do it", and I remember my uncle being impatient and taking a much more "why are you crying? Don't be such a baby." attitude.
I'm wondering if that was what was going on with George, I was being the "Bad Cop" parent with him. "Projects always take longer than you think, they always cost more than you think. There are no guarantees in software development and I'm definitely not giving you one.  If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster." 
And George's reaction was to throw his rattle out of his pram (by throwing the phone down).  Twice.
We could have both probably handled it better.  We were very much in the "storming" phase of our relationship. I suppose it might have been that I'd already got some awareness that George was aggressively and successfully bullying other people in the organisation that made me reluctant to engage.
